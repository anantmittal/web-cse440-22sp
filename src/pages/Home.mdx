# Course Overview

<Alert severity='error'>Content is Under Development and Subject to Change</Alert>

## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to human-computer interaction and the design process.
Students will learn methods and skills for designing and prototyping interactive systems.
The course covers a design process from the initial formulation of a design problem to creation of digital prototypes.
Importantly, the course does not emphasize development but instead fully focuses on design.

The course structure is a mix of lectures, hands-on activities, and design critiques by peers and course staff.
The course is overwhelmingly organized around a group project, in which students:

- Ideate and Propose Design Problems
- Study Existing Practices and Challenges
- Explore Potential Design Opportunities and Tradeoffs
- Evaluate and Iterate Upon a Design
- Communicate a Problem and Resulting Design

## Learning Objectives

- Process-Focused Perspective on Interaction Design
- Design Research Methods and Skills
- Task-Focused Scenario Development, Sketching, and Storyboarding
- Rapid Prototyping and Iteration
- Critical Perspective on Design Solutions

## Grading

Strive to do good work because you care about your own opportunities to learn,
including the opportunities this course provides working with a group in an intensive project.

The overall course grade will be computed as follows:

<Alert severity='error'>Grading is Under Development and Subject to Change</Alert>

- __65%__: Group Project
  - __5%__: Assignment 1, Project Brainstorming and Proposal
  - __20%__: Assignment 2, Getting the Right Design
  - __20%__: Assignment 3, Getting the Design Right
  - __20%__: Assignment 4, Communicating the Design
- __10%__: Participation
- __25%__: Exam

Each assignment will also provide a point breakdown intended to convey how it will be graded.
Design is an inherently subjective practice, and so grading in this course is necessarily subjective.
The stated project requirements are the minimum,
intended to leave room for groups to earn strong grades through strong work.

Because the course is designed around feedback on project milestones, grades given to those milestones indicate
that you have invested sufficient effort and insight at the time of the milestone.
You will get feedback and are expected to continue acting upon that feedback in your design process.
The bulk of project grades is therefore attached to the final deliverables, which are evaluated on their quality.

## Participation and Safety

We are all living in challenging times.
Our goal is for this course to provide an opportunity for learning without undermining wellness or safety.
Active participation in activities is central to this course,
and we all share responsibility for preserving safety of this learning environment.
Please review and adhere to related policies, including the
[UW COVID-19 FAQ for students](https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/student-faq/).

### Course Staff Masking Statements

James, Qisheng, Jesse, Anant, and Jason have all indicated
they plan to wear masks in class (i.e., in lecture, in section).

James and Jesse will hold office hours via Zoom.

Qisheng will hold office hours in-person, and has indicated they will wear a mask.

We also encourage you to wear a mask, although UW policies make clear this is optional.

## Remote Participation and Recordings

In-person attendance is generally expected and is part of participation grading,
but there may be reasons you cannot or should not attend in-person
(e.g., COVID symptoms, COVID exposure).
In these circumstances, contact the course staff for permission to attend remotely.
If you are unsure whether you should attend,
please reach out and know that we will do our best to be accommodating.
Our goal is to encourage and support you in decisions that preserve safety.

Students with permission may attend via the Zoom link provided in <CourseInformationLink linkName='linkCanvas' anchorText='Canvas' />.
A member of the course staff will also aim to monitor the Zoom chat for questions.
If class splits into project group activities,
the Zoom meeting will end and remote students should join their group
via a video call with a member of their group.

We will also use the in-room Panopto system to record lecture components of the course.
This can support review of material, but is not a substitute for in-person studio activities.

## Accommodations and Additional University Policies

Additional university policies apply
(e.g., regarding Academic Integrity, Conduct, Disability Resources, Face Covering, Religious Accommodations):

Please do not hesitate to contact the course staff regarding these or any other accommodations.
We are happy that you are here and want to support your engagement in this learning environment.
